# Running KMC1D Calculate Main Effect Kinship Matrix
Welcome to use **KMC1D** to calculate **Main Effect Kinship Matrix**. In this repository, except this README file, you also should see another **INSTALL md** file for instructions to **compile the source code**;  a **PDF** file for user manual to **run KMC1D**; a sub-directory: **Source_Code**, which you can compile into a **binary KMC1D** execute command; One zipped file: **Simulated_Data.zip**, which should be unziped at first, and by which you can play with a series of simulated genotypic matrix data with dimension of **m** rows(markers)x **n** columns (individuals); and another zipped file **Run_Test.zip**, which should be unzipped at first and by which you can test the availability of GPU **hardware** environment, CUDA-Nividia  software **Toolkits**, **Packages**, and tentatively **Run** your data at **bash shell** model. 
Essentially, **KMC1D** only can run on a **CUDA-capable GPU Linux** Server. Here, we provide three methods for you (See the **User Manual**). You can run it at our host GPU sever, or download the source code, compile and run it at your CUDA-capable GPU server.   
If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to contact bioinfo AT noble.org with our developer's team through **wezhang AT noble.org**.
